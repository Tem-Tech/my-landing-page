      <p>
        The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and
        shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by
        Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in
        American comic books published by Marvel Comics.Marvel phases are a way
        of grouping several films in the MCU together. Phase 1 introduces us to
        each of the Avengers. Phase 2 handles the fallout from The Avengers.
        Phase 3 features an uneasiness among the superheroes after Avengers: Age
        of Ultron (and introduces more heroes), leading us into the showstopping
        Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame. Phase 4 will introduce a
        new wave of heroes and explore a post-Endgame world where half of the
        universe reappeared five years after an event known as the ‚ÄúBlip.‚Äù
